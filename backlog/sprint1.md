### INVEST User Stories

**INVEST** is an acronym that stands for Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, and Testable. These criteria ensure well-written user stories that are actionable and deliver value. Below are three examples:

---

### **User Story 1: Search Functionality**
**As a user**,  
I want to search for products using keywords,  
**so that** I can quickly find items I am interested in purchasing.

- **Independent**: This story can be implemented without depending on other features.  
- **Negotiable**: The specifics of the search functionality (e.g., filters, auto-suggestions) can be discussed and adjusted.  
- **Valuable**: It allows users to locate products efficiently, improving their experience.  
- **Estimable**: Developers can estimate the time required to implement a basic search feature.  
- **Small**: The scope is narrow, focusing only on keyword-based search.  
- **Testable**: Test cases can verify that searching for a keyword returns relevant results.

### **User Story 2: Notification Settings**
**As a user**,  
I want to customize my notification preferences,  
**so that** I only receive updates that are relevant to me.

- **Independent**: Customizing notification settings can be developed separately from other features.  
- **Negotiable**: The types of notifications (e.g., email, SMS, app alerts) can be defined collaboratively.  
- **Valuable**: Users gain control over their experience, reducing annoyance from irrelevant notifications.  
- **Estimable**: Developers can estimate the time to create a settings interface and backend logic.  
- **Small**: The story focuses solely on notification preferences, without tying into broader account settings.  
- **Testable**: Test cases can ensure that toggling preferences enables/disables the corresponding notifications.

### **User Story 3: Password Reset**
**As a user**,  
I want to reset my password via email,  
**so that** I can regain access to my account if I forget my credentials.

- **Independent**: Password reset functionality can be implemented without relying on other features.  
- **Negotiable**: The method of password reset (e.g., email link, security questions) can be discussed.  
- **Valuable**: Users can recover account access, ensuring usability and security.  
- **Estimable**: Developers can estimate the time for creating the reset flow and email integration.  
- **Small**: The scope is limited to password reset via email.  
- **Testable**: Test cases can verify that the password reset process works as intended (e.g., email is sent, link expires after a set time).
